donation-description = Scripty is not cheap to run. It is currently running on a $1,500 USD server with an
 AMD Ryzen 9 3900 CPU and 128GB RAM. Even with that hardware, we estimate it can only handle
 100 concurrent transcriptions. Donations would allow us to scale our hardware capacity and
 handle many more concurrent transcriptions, perhaps tens of thousands someday with enough donations.\n\n
 Training a model is not easy either, as that needs relatively recent (CUDA 10.1 support)
 Nvidia GPUs. We hate asking for donations, but we absolutely can't support the bot out of our
 own pockets, since it's just too expensive. So we're asking for help, and giving rewards in the
 form of premium subscriptions.\n\n
 You can view more info at https://scripty.org/premium, but the gist of it is that there are 6
 tiers ranging in price from $5 USD to $100 USD per month. The $100 tier comes with its own
 managed instance of Scripty for your own server, with a custom name, and profile picture.\n\n
 We also support one-time donations directly through GitHub Sponsors:
