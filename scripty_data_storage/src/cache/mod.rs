//! Cache for data storage.
//!
//! Because data storage can ingest huge amounts of data, it is necessary to cache whether or not a user has opted
//! in to a particular data type being stored.
//!
//! This module provides abstractions for the cache, allowing for a quick, and easy way to check a user's status.
//!
//! A user can be opted into either storing their voice data, message data, neither, or both. As such, the cache
//! requires multiple functions to check the status of a user.
